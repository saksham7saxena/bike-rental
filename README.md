# Bike Rental Management System

A C++ console-based application for managing a bike rental service. This project features a menu-driven interface to handle bikes, riders, and rental transactions using file handling for data persistence.

## Overview

This project was developed as a Computer Science project during Class XII. It demonstrates core C++ concepts such as classes, objects, file handling, and menu-driven logic.

## Features

*   **Bike Management**: Add, delete, search, and view available bikes.
*   **Rider Management**: Register, edit, delete, and search for rider details.
*   **Rental System**: Issue bikes to riders and handle returns.
*   **Data Persistence**: Uses binary files (`.dat`) to store records securely.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language**: C++
*   **Compatibility**: Designed for Turbo C++ compiler (uses headers like `fstream.h`, `conio.h`).

## Usage

1.  Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (preferably Turbo C++ or DOSBox for full compatibility).
2.  Run the executable.
3.  Use the main menu to navigate through Bike Management, Rider Management, and Rental operations.

## Disclaimer

This is a legacy project and uses older C++ standards. It may require modifications to compile on modern GCC/Clang compilers (e.g., updating headers to `<iostream>`, removing `conio.h` dependencies).
